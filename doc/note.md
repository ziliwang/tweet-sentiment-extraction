1. The noise is randomly added in the span of the select string, it's impossible to recover the origin annotation.
2. new train set update. The target cv is 0.712.
3. stat. no url in positive annotation, no url in negative. mainly url in neutral(neutral has 580 which gt is 346). This mean the neutral can be the origin with no modify. And positive or negative show not contain the urls.
4. add rules based on 3, bring little improvement.
